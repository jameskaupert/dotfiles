# dotfiles

This is an archived snapshot of my dotfiles. I've recently taken my dotfiles private in another repo to explore AI integration. They are not yet at a point for public consumption. 

## Installation (Unix)
1. `cd ~`
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/jameskaupert/dotfiles.git`
3. `cd dotfiles`
4. Run `./setup`
